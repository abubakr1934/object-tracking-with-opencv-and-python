***Object Detection in Traffic Video using OpenCV and Python***
**Overview**
This project demonstrates the implementation of object detection using OpenCV and Python, specifically focusing on detecting cars in a traffic video. The goal is to identify and track vehicles within a given video stream, providing a practical application for real-world scenarios such as traffic monitoring and management.

**Features**
Object Detection: Utilizing the OpenCV library, the project implements a robust object detection algorithm to identify and locate cars in each frame of the video.

Tracking: The application incorporates object tracking to follow the detected cars across consecutive frames. This helps in understanding the movement and behavior of vehicles over time.

Video Input: The system is designed to work with standard video formats, making it easy to integrate with various traffic surveillance systems or pre-recorded video footage.

Visualization: The project includes visualization tools to draw bounding boxes around detected cars, providing a clear representation of the object detection process.

**Acknowledgments**
The project was inspired by the need for efficient traffic monitoring solutions.
Thanks to the OpenCV community for providing a powerful computer vision library.
Feel free to modify the content to better suit the specifics of your project and include any additional details that might be relevant.

**Note:**
1.the YOLOV4 config files are present in the dnn_model folder can be used directly
2.prefer doing this on pycharm instead of jupyter notebook
